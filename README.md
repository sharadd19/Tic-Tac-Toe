## Description 
This project was part of one of the projects to complete in [_The Odin Project_](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-tic-tac-toe) course for full-stack web development. 

The goal of this application was to build the Tic Tac Toe game 

I have created a few js files:
1. `console-script.js` which is a console version of the game. This is how I first began to build the game
2. `computer-script.js` which is the main js file used in the app
3. `script.js` which is a two player game version


## Built with
- JavaScript
- HTML
- CSS

## Key concepts and learnings
- Modules
- Immediately Invoked Function Expressions (IIFE)
- DOM Manipulation
- Prototypes and creating custom method on Array prototype

## Challenges
- Building the game in a console without a frontend
- Determining how you can check for wins using the winning combinations array
